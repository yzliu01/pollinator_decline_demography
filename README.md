# Pollinator decline demography

Simulate and infer recent demographic trajectories using Stairway Plot 2. 

The repository documents the scripts we used for simulations and reconstructions of demographic changes from simulated and Pool-seq data. Simulated data using fastsimcoal2 are for demographic scenarios with population size changes â‰¤ 1000 generations (year when generation time is one year) before presen. The demographic reconstructions based on site frequency spectra (SFS) using Stairway Plot 2 are for the simulated genomic data and Pool-seq data include the recent demographic trajectories for two pairs of representative common (non-endangered) and rear (endangered) wilde bee species.

Note: when one uses the codes to reproduce the results or figures and so on, the codes need to be revised accordingly depending on own directory and file names.
